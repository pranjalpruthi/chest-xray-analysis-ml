Lung diseases are the primary cause of death in most countries. The chest X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans are few available diagnosis methods for detecting and analyzing the disease severity. Among the diagnoses stated, X-ray is the most commonly used modality. 

The use of medical imaging with deep learning for classification is the current academic research direction & recently while COVID-19 is also a kind of pneumonia caused by coronavirus. Chest X-rays can help in early detection and isolation of patients.

TB is a deadly disease that is responsible for a million death according to World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis report . Mantoux tuberculin skin tests (TST) or TB blood tests are conducted to detect it, but these tests are expensive. Chest X-rays are cheap and fast that can help in pulmonary TB detection
